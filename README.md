**Brief summary of evolution findings:**
* I noticed a gradual increase in the fitness score of individuals as more generations passed --> survival of the fittest!
* It only took one evolution to produce a perfect palindrome chromosome, and as generations went on, there was often an alternating pattern in the chromosomes between two letters (ie. EDEDEDE, or CBCBC)
* Furthermore, most of the winning individuals who wre allowed to reproduce had an odd number of letters in its chromosome.


**Reflection on Your experience with this assignment:**
* I found this assignment to be a good review on constructors and methods involving taking substrings and concatenation
* Also a good exercise involving arraylists and optimizing the amount of time to execute by using constant methods rather than linear methods (initializing the population once, then resetting each element per evolution)
